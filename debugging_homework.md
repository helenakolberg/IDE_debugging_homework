Answer the following questions:  

1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?  
**Answer:** When we run the application, it will run as normal until it gets to the breakpoint, it then pauses the application and launches the debugger.  
  
2. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?  
**Answer:** No, the debugger is launched before that line.  
  
3. How do we debug the next line of code?  
**Answer:** Use the step over command.  
  
4. What does the step into command do?  
**Answer:** It will switch to the method on that line and pause at the top of that method.  
  
5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?  
**Answer:** In the evaluate expression mode we can run a single line of code, in the evaluate code fragment mode we can run multiple lines of code.
